      <p>
        Since I can remember, my curiosity has been a driving force in my life, pushing me to explore and create
        at
        every opportunity. Growing up, I was always the one with a knack for making things, whether it was
        building
        intricate models or crafting unique creations from everyday materials. This innate sense of craftsmanship
        fueled my passion for creating and innovating, shaping me into the entrepreneurial-minded individual I am
        today. From designing my own small business ventures as a child to pursuing game development as a career,
        my
        journey has been fueled by a relentless desire to turn ideas into reality and leave my mark on the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was in the realm of gaming that my true passion ignited, sparked by my first foray into the
        pixelated
        landscapes of Minecraft back in 2012. In those blocky worlds, I discovered a canvas for creativity and a
        playground for endless exploration. While others were drawn to more mainstream titles, it was games like
        Garry's Mod that captured my imagination, allowing me to unleash my creativity in ways I had never
        imagined.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I delved deeper into the world of gaming, I realized the profound impact it could have on psychology
        and
        human behavior. This realization led me to pursue a path of self-education, honing my skills and knowledge
        in game development. While mostly self-taught, I recognized the importance of formal education and
        enrolled
        in a game development program to refine my craft and expand my network.</p>

      <p>
        My journey in game development has been a blend of self-discovery and formal education. Through hands-on
        projects and collaborative efforts, I've honed my skills in game, level, narrative, UI, and system design.
        Each challenge has been an opportunity for growth, pushing me to expand my horizons and push the
        boundaries
        of what's possible in game development.</p>

      <p>
        Now, as I embark on the next chapter of my journey, I am driven by a desire to craft experiences that
        leave
        a lasting impression, just as the games of my childhood have done for me. With a blend of passion,
        creativity, and technical expertise, I aim to carve out my own path in the ever-evolving world of game
        development.</p>
